# Mesh_Collider
Attempt to create a generated mesh that is also a collision surface

Also does a level of detail overlay with 3 different chunking levels.
Just an experiment that doesn't really do what I had hoped.

Far from perfect, but decided to park this in a "demo-able" state and work on other things.
